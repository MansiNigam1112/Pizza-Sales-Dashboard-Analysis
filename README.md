# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard-Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of basic SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) for a pizza business. The KPIs include Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas per Order. The project addresses problem statements such as daily and monthly trends for total orders, percentage of sales by pizza category, and top and bottom sellers by revenue, quantity, and orders. Power BI and PostgreSQL are utilized to create two dashboards that visualize these SQL query results, providing comprehensive insights into the business's performance.
